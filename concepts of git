basic concepts of git.

1. Concepts of Git Explained:

Version Control System (VCS): Git serves as a distributed version control system, overseeing modifications in source code during software development.

Repository (Repo): A repository acts as a storage facility housing project files and the complete history of alterations.

Commit: A commit denotes a snapshot capturing changes made to the code, marking a distinct point in the project's evolution.

Branch: A branch represents an autonomous line of development, enabling work on features or bug fixes without impacting the main codebase.

Merge: Merging combines alterations from diverse branches into a unified branch, typically employed to integrate a feature branch into the main one.

Pull Request (PR): A pull request is a proposal for changes submitted by a user, requesting the integration of a set of modifications into the main branch.

Clone: Cloning involves creating a local copy of a remote repository.

Fork: Forking entails creating a personal duplicate of someone else's project, facilitating experimentation without affecting the original project.

Remote: A remote refers to a version of the repository hosted on a server, with Git supporting multiple remotes for fetching and pushing changes.

Push and Pull: Pushing involves sending committed changes to a remote repository, while pulling fetches changes from a remote repository to the local one.

2. Basic Git Commands:

git init: Initiates a new Git repository.
git clone [repository_url]: Replicates a remote repository onto the local machine.
git add [file]: Appends changes in the working directory to the staging area.
git commit -m "commit message": Records changes from the staging area to the repository.
git status: Displays the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
git pull: Retrieves changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
git push: Transfers committed changes to a remote repository.

3. Concepts on GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket:

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories, incorporating features like issue tracking, pull requests, and actions.

GitLab: Similar to GitHub, GitLab is a web-based platform offering repository hosting, CI/CD pipelines, and project management.

BitBucket: BitBucket, by Atlassian, serves as a Git repository management solution, providing features for source code management, build automation, and collaboration.

4. Industrial Practices of Using Git:

Feature Branching: Employ separate branches for features or bug fixes to streamline change management.

Pull Requests: Utilize pull requests for thorough code review before merging changes into the main branch.

Continuous Integration (CI): Integrate CI tools to automate the building and testing of code with each modification.

Version Tagging: Label releases with version numbers for simplified tracking and reference.

5. Cloning a Repo to Local:

Open a terminal.
Nav6igate to the directory where you wish to clone the repository.
Execute git clone [repository_url].
